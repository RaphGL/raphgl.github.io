    <p>Like many, I enjoy Python and the versatility and speed of development it provides. But, to me Python tooling is a big deal breaker. It&rsquo;s insane, there&rsquo;s way too many ways to do things. Not to mention that documentation in the official python website is kind of convoluted, you end up going through hoops to understand whatever you need or relying on other people&rsquo;s tutorials, videos, etc, to understand them, even then it can be overwhelming the amount of choices there are in python. For python bundling you have: wheels, pyinstaller, py2exe. For configuration you have: setup.py, setup.cfg, pyproject.toml. Then you need to configure your environment: pyenv, pipenv, virtualenv. This goes on and on and the recommend one seems to change every couple of years.</p>
<p>For people that have come from other languages, this seems pure insanity and learning that you actually need all of these to actually spin up your project for prodution is kind of insane. I truly wished python had sane tooling and a de facto way of doing things, unfortunately that isn&rsquo;t the case, but fret not, there&rsquo;s a solution.</p>
<p>Someone recommended me to look at Poetry. Poetry is a third party package manager that&rsquo;s better than Pip and actually does what it&rsquo;s supposed to do, it wraps around all the insanity in python and let&rsquo;s you focus on what&rsquo;s important.</p>
<p>The advantages of using Poetry:</p>
<ul>
<li>Saner environment</li>
<li>The virtual environment is dealt with for you</li>
<li>Dependency management is actually enjoyable and you can pin and track dependencies&rsquo; version</li>
<li>Building and publishing projects is a breeze</li>
</ul>
