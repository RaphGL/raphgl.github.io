  <p>
    Hi, I'm Raph. I'm a developer interested in making software that's useful to
    me and others. I'm very interested in learning more web development and
    low level system programming. (Keeping my eye on embedded for later).
  </p>
  <p>
    I started programming back in 2017, when I had just switched to linux and
    over time I started scripting things and making tiny utilities for myself.
    Eventually I went deeper and deeper into it and ended up loving it.

  <h2>Tech Stack</h2>
  <p>
    I use mostly Go, C, Rust, Python and TypeScript and am still constantly
    learning more about them. You can find me on the following platforms:
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://github.com/RaphGL/">Github</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://codeberg.org/RaphGL/">Codeberg</a></li>
      <li><a href="https://gitlab.com/RaphGL/">Gitlab</a></li>
    </ul>
  </p>

  <h2>Other hobbies</h2>
  <p>
    Aside from programming, I'm also interested in learning more maths and
    electronics (and struggle doing so lol). On my free time I also play piano,
    dabble a tiny bit in design and content creation and learn (human and
    computer) languages I'll probably never get to use!
