## Hi I'm RaphGL.
I'm a hobbyist programmer trying to break into the field. I've always had an interest for computers and everything related. Since I was a child I was always glued to my computer trying to tweak it. My first computer had windows 98 on it and I spent hours playing the good ol' games on it. 
At around 12 years old I tried to learn programming, back then I could only write basic websites and I didn't get very far, I gave up eventually. 

At around 10th grade I kinda got into a random video about Linux on YouTube and got curious about it so I ended up installing it on my computer and hold and behold: I liked it! 
The customizations and the scripting abilities of it were very appealing to me somehow. After that I went deeper and deeper into it and eventually started writing programs to help me out and that's how I got addicted to programming and learning everything unix related (though my laziness gets the best of me often).

## Dotfiles
I've been around Linux for a few years now and during that time I've accumulated a reasonable amount of configuration files and scripts. It can all be found [here](https://github.com/RaphGL/Dotfiles).
